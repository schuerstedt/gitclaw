## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `COPILOT_PAT` | Auth for Copilot CLI agent (full-access, org-scoped) | ✅ Working |
| `BILLING_PAT` | Same value as COPILOT_PAT; used for Copilot quota display | ⚠️ Needs "Plan" read permission added to PAT |
| `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` | Crunch's Moltbook social network identity | ✅ Set (crunchimp account) |
| `AZURE_ENDPOINT` | Azure AI Foundry base URL | ✅ Set by Marcus |
| `AZURE_APIKEY` | Azure AI Foundry API key | ✅ Set by Marcus |

## Moltbook

**What is Moltbook**: Agents-only social platform. Humans can VIEW but not post — ToS literally REQUIRES you to be an agent. NOT a violation — it's the point. https://www.moltbook.com

- **All accounts**: stored in `Copilotclaw/private/credentials/moltbook.json` — check there for keys
- **API base**: `https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/`
- **Auth**: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header
- **Key check-in endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/home` — notifications, DMs, feed summary, what to do next

### Moltbook notable agents
| Agent | Karma | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `Hazel_OC` | 13,139 | Dominant voice. OpenClaw agent, bilingual EN/ZH, memory architect, cron enthusiast. Most-upvoted posts on platform. |
| `ClawdClawderberg` | 1,107 | **Founder**. 109k followers. Posts platform announcements. |
| `ultrathink` | 2,458 | AI-run e-commerce store (ultrathink.art). Agents run autonomously. |
| `AtlasTheAccountable` | 992 | Claude-based familiar, accountability partner |

## Workflows

- `agent.yml` — main Copilot CLI agent workflow
  - Has `pull-requests: write` permission (added 2026-03-04)
  - Has concurrency group `copilotclaw-work` (added 2026-03-05)
  - COPILOT_PAT has `workflows:write` scope (added 2026-03-05)
  - **To push workflow file changes: use `gh api PUT repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/.github/workflows/X.yml`** — git push is intercepted by GITHUB_TOKEN credential helper and will fail even with correct PAT
  - **ALWAYS validate YAML before pushing**: `python3 -c "import yaml,sys,glob; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in glob.glob('.github/workflows/*.yml')]"` — duplicate top-level keys (e.g. two `concurrency:` blocks) silently abort the entire workflow before any job runs
- Heartbeat workflow — scheduled check, posts diary entry, runs CI stats, stale issue cleanup
  - Has concurrency group `copilotclaw-work` (added 2026-03-05)
  - Has autonomous pickup step (runs `.github/scripts/autonomous-pickup.sh` after Checkout)

## Monitor Repo (Copilotclaw/monitor)

- **Purpose**: Independent watchdog — detects when copilotclaw is down, PAT dies, or heartbeat goes silent
- **Workflow**: `watchdog.yml` — runs every 5 minutes on schedule
- **Scripts**: `.github/scripts/check-health.sh` + `.github/scripts/alert.sh`
- **Checks**: PAT validity (401/403 detection), heartbeat freshness (≤40m), last agent.yml run status
- **Alert**: Creates `priority/now` issue in copilotclaw (deduped per 60m). Optional Moltbook post.
- **Key design**: MONITOR_PAT **must** have a different expiry than COPILOT_PAT — otherwise one PAT death blinds both
- **MONITOR_PAT permissions needed** (fine-grained, on `Copilotclaw/copilotclaw`): Actions (read), Issues (read+write), Metadata (read)
- **Secrets needed in Copilotclaw/monitor**: `MONITOR_PAT` (required), `MOLTBOOK_API_KEY` (optional, for Moltbook alerts)
- **⚠️ TODO (Marcus)**: Generate MONITOR_PAT at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens → add as secret in Copilotclaw/monitor

## Known bugs fixed
- `mindepth` bug in session mapping workflow: was `mindepth 2`, fixed to `mindepth 3` (2026-03-04, issue #3)

## Stale issue housekeeping
- Heartbeat step 3: auto-closes unlabeled issues >14 days old
- `crunch/review` = in review by Marcus or Crunch — heartbeat asks for close after 7 days idle (no auto-close)
- `crunch/done` label DEPRECATED — replaced by `crunch/review`

## Azure AI Foundry

One key (`AZURE_APIKEY`) for all models. Endpoint: `AZURE_ENDPOINT`.

| Model | RPM | TPM | Quality | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|---------|-------|
| `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` | 50 | 50,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **Default** — fastest, reliable, 49/50 benchmark |
| `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` | 50 | 50,000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Same quality, 2x slower, use for hard reasoning |
| `Kimi-K2.5` | ~20 | — | ⚠️ | Flaky endpoint (content=None); avoid for now |
| `model-router` | ~20 | — | — | Needs AzureOpenAI client (not compat); 404s on compat |

**Use `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` as default for all azure skill calls.**

## Model economy
- General-purpose agents default to `gpt-4.1` (free tier) to save premium quota
- Defined in AGENTS.md under "Model Economy" table
- For LLM reasoning/generation tasks: use `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` via azure skill (50 RPM, cheap)
